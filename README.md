# What is this guide about?

This guide will explain how to make your first ML Rocket League bot with RLGym-PPO, a nice and easy-to-use learning framework.
I will both be explaining how to use the library, as well as how to make a bot in general. 

*If you notice a mistake in this guide, let me know!*

## Prerequisites

If you want to learn how to train ML, bots, the only three requirements are:
- Knowing how to code (preferably in Python)
- Having a PC to train the bot on
- Not giving up easily

This guide assumes you have some basic Python experience. 
If you are coming from another language, that's fine too, but you might need to google some basic stuff and watch a few tutorials along the way.

I won't hand-hold basic Python tasks like adding an import or making a function, nor will I explain what an argument or constructor is. 
If you don't know, google it!

You don't need any prior experience in machine learning.
Feel free to skip ahead if I cover something you already understand.
